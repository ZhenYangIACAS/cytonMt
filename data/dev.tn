Al Gore : Averting the climate crisis
We went in and sat down at the booth , and the waitress came over , made a big commotion over Tipper . She took our order , and then went to the couple in the booth next to us , and she lowered her voice so much , I had to really strain to hear what she was saying .
Chris Anderson : It 's a deal !
And so we should address that . But it 's part of the puzzle .
And what it means is elaborated at climatecrisis.net.
And so I 'm going to be conducting a course this summer for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse , in communities all across the country , and we 're going to update the slideshow for all of them every single week , to keep it right on the cutting edge .
Somebody said the test we 're facing now , a scientist told me , is whether the combination of an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination .
I know Bill Joy was talking to you about the wonders of carbon nanotubes , so I 'm going to talk to you about the wonders of carbon macro-tubes , which is charcoal .
So it was a little discouraging to the students .
And you can make a very thick , sticky porridge out of it , which you can use to bind together the charcoal briquettes .
And after some time , we developed a low-cost press that allows you to produce charcoal , which actually now burns not only -- actually , it burns longer , cleaner than wood charcoal .
But once you see it , like you guys in the front row -- All right , yeah , OK . So anyway -- Here it is . And this is , I think , a perfect example of what Robert Wright was talking about in those non-zero-sum things .
These are the solutions that we need to find .
We have 30 students a year go out into the field and try to implement this and move it forward .
We have three critical terms : economy , and the state . I will not deal with those first two , except to say that uncritical transfer of assumptions , from one context to another , can only make for disaster . Economics taught in most of the elite universities are practically useless in my context .
Do we need to repeat the modalities that we have inherited ?
No . But seriously , the issue of Afghanistan first has to be seen as , at least , a 10- to 20-year perspective .
In terms of their discourse , in terms of their sophistication of knowledge of the world , I think that I would dare say , they 're much more sophisticated than rural Americans with college degrees and the bulk of Europeans -- because the world matters to them .
If you want us to be able to compete with China and to attract investment , we could probably attract four to six billion dollars quite easily in the textile sector , if there was zero tariffs -- would create the type of job . Cotton does not compete with opium ; a t-shirt does . And we need to understand , it 's the value chain .
And every year there must be progress on mobilization of domestic revenue and generation of the economy .
Let 's take a snapshot at aviation .
And then I went in and I had a lot of fun building airplanes that people could build in their garages .
The very first year , starting when Gagarin went in space , and a few weeks later Alan Shepherd , there were five manned space flights in the world -- the very first year .
OK . My critics say , " Hey , Rutan 's just spending a lot of these billionaires ' money for joyrides for billionaires .
But something is out there to inspire our kids now .
But anyway , I think we need to beat them again .
Now at this point you 're going to see a picture of Michelangelo .
That was 100 years right there -- did you catch that ?
We 're trying to find the beauty in the truth .
The idea of people-work is what we work with here , and I have to make a bond with my designers when we 're creating BMWs .
They 've got that gene infected in them as well , and they want that to live , more than anything else .
The bathroom was so big , she built the bed over the bathtub -- it 's quite fascinating .
There was a whole lot of dialog .
He said , " Love is not selfish , " he said , " Love does not mean counting how many times I say , ' I love you . ' It doesn 't mean you had sex this many times this month , and it 's two times less than last month , so that means you don 't love me as much .
And this will be my only comment on it .
For example , it was thought that the visual pigments that are in our eyes -- there was only one or two organisms in the environment that had these same pigments .
And if you take all animals together , we probably share less than 30,000 and probably maybe a dozen or more thousand different gene families .
We found that synthesizing accurate DNA in large pieces was extremely difficult .
This organism is ubiquitous on the planet , and exists perhaps now in outer space due to all our travel there .
Pharmaceutical production is already under way in major laboratories using microbes .
In my dreams I fantasize of wreaking vengeance on you guys .
I call it " software rage . "
Making a squeaking noise .
They said , " Well , wait a minute . Everyone complains that we 're adding so many features .
They could have put them all out in view .
Now , it would be inconsistent to put " United States " first , but it would be intelligent . This one 's been touched on before , but why in God 's name do you shut down a Windows PC by clicking a button called " Start ? "
Yes , I do .
They 're locked in , because so many add-ons and other company stuff locks into the old 1982 chassis .
Thank you . So Steve Jobs had always believed in simplicity and elegance and beauty .
Chris Anderson : Oh yeah . DP : Hold that and don 't let go .
Because for years , people had bought this software , tried it out -- 95 percent accuracy was all they got , which means one in 20 words is wrong -- and they 'd put it in their drawer . And the company got sick of that , so they said , " This version , we 're not going to do anything , but make sure it 's darned accurate . "
Tourist : I 've taken my step-daughter here from Indianapolis .
KA : This is not an obvious subject to be in the sensuality segment , but certainly David you are known as -- I know , a phrase you hate -- an entertainment architect .
There was a school , PS 234 , that had been evacuated down at Ground Zero .
The city actually approached us .
KA : But then you 've got to figure out a way -- we will skip over the insanely tedious process of getting permits and getting everybody on board -- but simply funding this thing .
We had a meeting that evening with his contractor of choice , and the contractor showed up with the drawings of the platform about half the size that we had drawn it .
Richard , I think very correctly , made the point at the beginning -- before all the chair designers came out -- about the history of chair designers imposing aesthetic solutions on this kind of universal , banal , common problem of sitting .
Where it overlaps with thoughts about our work in general is , number one -- the notion of collaboration as a sort of way to get things done .
KA : Well , I think that 's interesting .
One of the tricky issues we had with the Giuliani administration was I had forgotten how anti-graffiti he was .
They pointed out that , I believe it was between 30 and 50 years from today , they will be steering cars by wire , without all that mechanical stuff .
By the 1950s , we started connecting all the towns together with what a lot of people claim is the eighth wonder of the world , the highway system .
And again , I say that not to attack any industry , I think -- I really do -- I love my airplane , and cars on highways moving 60 miles an hour are extraordinarily efficient , both from an engineering point of view , an energy consumption point of view , and a utility point of view .
65 percent of the landmass of our cities are parked cars .
But if I could ask you to do one thing , it 's not to think about it as a piece of technology , but just imagine that , although we all understand somehow that it 's reasonable that we use our 4,000-pound machine , which can go 60 miles an hour , that can bring you everywhere you want to go , and somehow it 's also what we used for the last mile , and it 's broken , and it doesn 't work .
In Asia alone , it will be over a billion people .
It makes just enough electricity to , for instance , do this , which at night is enough electricity , in the rest of the world , as Mr. Holly -- Dr. Holly -- pointed out , can run computers and a light bulb .
Heart and blood vessel diseases still kill more people -- not only in this country , but also worldwide -- than everything else combined , and yet it 's completely preventable for almost everybody .
And this man , he has been outside , but he 's gone back , and he was saying , " You know , we have suddenly jumped into a whole new era , and we didn 't even know about the white man 50 years ago , and now here we are with laptop computers , and there are some things we want to learn from the modern world .
And of course , there 's developments in infrared , so you can watch animals at night , and equipment for recording by video , and tape recording is getting lighter and better .
Moreover , we know that in different parts of Africa , wherever chimps have been studied , there are completely different tool-using behaviors .
But this teaches us a new respect -- and it 's a new respect not only for the chimpanzees , I suggest , but some of the other amazing animals with whom we share this planet .
Of course , but if you 've seen the crippling poverty in some of these parts of the world it isn 't a question of " Let 's leave the tree for tomorrow . "
Somebody said that yesterday .
One for animals , including domestic animals -- and I have to say , I learned everything I know about animal behavior even before I got to Gombe and the chimps from my dog , Rusty , who was my childhood companion .
And then , lo and behold , there 's another group answering these kids who may be in America , or maybe this is a group in Israel , saying , " Yeah , you did it a little bit wrong . This is how you should do it . "
You travel , you see all these horrible things happening . "
We 're the ones who can make a difference .
And my mother bought this book when we were at the Grand Canyon called " The Hot Zone . " It was all about the outbreak of the Ebola virus .
And from then on , since I was now in this huge exciting world , I wanted to explore it all . I wanted it all at once , but knew I couldn 't really get that .
We 're removing the cancer cells , but we 're revealing the previous damage that the body has tried to fix .
And furthermore , that nervous tissue -- brain -- gets cancer , and brain cells are also terminally differentiated .
So a tumor expresses chemokine receptors , and another organ -- a distant organ somewhere in the body -- will have the corresponding chemokines , and the tumor will see these chemokines and migrate towards it .
And again , some of these may be far-fetched , but I figured if there 's anywhere to present far-fetched ideas , it 's here at TED , so thank you very much .
But that 's an interesting thing for a creative person .
So , I thought , " Yeah , that 's probably a good idea . "
FG : I don 't really know .
They want to add to it and it 's hard to add to a building like that -- it 's a beautiful , minimalist , black steel building -- and Richard wants to add a library and more student stuff and it 's a lot of acreage .
It 's a richer experience .
My preconception of Bilbao was this wonderful building , you go inside and there 'd be extraordinary spaces .
They were there three days and it rained every day and they kept walking around -- I noticed they were looking under things and looking for things , and they wanted to know where the buckets were hidden , you know ?
RSW : At a certain point a number of years ago , people -- when Michael Graves was a fashion , before teapots ...
And the guy looked at me and said , " Now what can I do for you , Mr. Gehry ? "
Golan Levin
Thanks very much . There 's always lots more .
In trying to understand romantic love , I decided I would read poetry from all over the world , and I just want to give you one very short poem from eighth-century China , because it 's an almost perfect example of a man who is focused totally on a particular woman .
But the main characteristics of romantic love are craving : an intense craving to be with a particular person , not just sexually , but emotionally .
In fact , I had always thought it was a series of emotions , from very high to very low .
I think romantic love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time , thereby conserving mating time and energy .
